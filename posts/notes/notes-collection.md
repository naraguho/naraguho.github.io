# Collection of Notes
I have been making classroom notes with \$\LaTeX\$ since my undergraduate years. Tragically, most of my notes were lost due to a malfunction of my laptop after graduation. I am now uploading the remaining notes from my undergraduate coursework and new notes from graduate school here. I will also try to update my notes on a weekly basis. Please access them by clicking the links below.

There might be typos and mistakes. If you happen to find one, please do not hesitate to contact me via my email.
